    <div class="class">On the Job is a 2013 Philippine crime-thriller film conceived and directed by Erik Matti (pictured), who co-wrote it with Michiko Yamamoto. Starring Gerald Anderson, Joel Torre, Joey Marquez and Piolo Pascual, it tells the story of two prisoners (Anderson and Torre) who are temporarily freed to carry out political executions, and two law enforcers (Marquez and Pascual) investigating a case connected to the prison gun-for-hire business. Star Cinema initially refused to produce the film due to its violent content, but in 2012 agreed to co-produce it with Reality Entertainment, Matti's independent film company. Filming took place in Manila and lasted 33 days, on a production budget of 47 million pesos (about US$1.1 million). On the Job was praised at the Directors' Fortnight at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. The film was released in the Philippines on August 28, 2013, and in the United States and Canada on September 27. It received positive reviews from foreign and domestic critics.
